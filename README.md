# AutonomousSystemBrake
Code used to dimension the ASB for the EPFL Racing Team during the autumn semester 2021.

The code is provided in 3 types of files :
* A single Notebook coded in Python 3. To run it, you can use Jupyter Notebook for example.
* A single Python 3 file. It was not designed to be used this way, but if you don't want to use the Notebook, you can open this.
* A PDF generated from the Notebook. If you just want to read the code, it may be the best opiton.
